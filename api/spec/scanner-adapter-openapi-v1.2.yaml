  title: Harbor Scanner Adapter API
  description: |
    ## Overview

    This API must be implemented in order to register a new artifact scanner in [Harbor](https://goharbor.io) registry.

    The [/scan](#operation/AcceptScanRequest) and [/scan/{scan_request_id}/report](#operation/GetScanReport) operations are responsible for the actual scanning and return a scan report that is visible in the Harbor web console.

    The [/scan](#operation/AcceptScanRequest) operation is asynchronous. It should enqueue the job for processing a scan request and return the identifier. This allows Harbor to poll a corresponding scan report with the
    [/scan/{scan_request_id}/report](#operation/GetScanReport) operation. Harbor will call the
    [/scan/{scan_request_id}/report](#operation/GetScanReport) operation periodically until it returns 200 or 500 status codes.

    The [/metadata](#operation/GetMetadata) operation allows a Harbor admin to configure and register a scanner
    and discover its capabilities.

    ## Capabilities

    | Capability Type | Supported consumed MIME types | Supported produced MIME types |
    | --------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
    |  vulnerability  | `application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json`<br>`application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json` | `application/vnd.scanner.adapter.vuln.report.harbor+json; version=1.0`<br>`application/vnd.security.vulnerability.report; version=1.1`<br>`application/vnd.scanner.adapter.vuln.report.raw`|
    |     sbom        | `application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json`<br>`application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json` | `application/vnd.security.sbom.report+json; version=1.0` |

    ScannerCapability:
      description: |
        Capability consists of the set of recognized artifact MIME types and the set of scanner report MIME types.

        For example, a scanner capable of analyzing Docker images and producing a vulnerabilities report recognizable
        by Harbor web console might be represented with the following capability:
        - consumes MIME types:
          - `application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json`
          - `application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json`
        - produces MIME types:
          - `application/vnd.scanner.adapter.vuln.report.harbor+json; version=1.0`

        For example, a scanner capable of analyzing artifacts and producing a sbom report recognizable
        by Harbor might be represented with the following capability:
        - type: sbom
        - consumes MIME types:
          - `application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json`
          - `application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json`
        - produces MIME types:
          - `application/vnd.security.sbom.report+json; version=1.0`

          - sbom
          description: |
            The type of the capability, for example, 'vulnerability' represents analyzing the artifact then producing the vulnerabilities report,
            'sbom' represents generating the corresponding sbom for the artifact which be scanned. In order to the backward and forward compatible,
            the field is optional, we think it's a original 'vulnerability' scan if no such field.

            dpkg-source in dpkg 1.3.0 through 1.18.23 is able to use a non-GNU patch program
            and does not offer a protection mechanism for blank-indented diff hunks, which
            allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks via a crafted
            Debian source package, as demonstrated by using of dpkg-source on NetBSD.

        A standard scale for measuring the severity of a vulnerability.

        * `Unknown` - either a security problem that has not been assigned to a priority yet or a priority that the
          scanner did not recognize.
        * `Negligible` - technically a security problem, but is only theoretical in nature, requires a very special
          situation, has almost no install base, or does no real damage.
        * `Low` - a security problem, but is hard to exploit due to environment, requires a user-assisted attack,
          a small install base, or does very little damage.
        * `Medium` - a real security problem, and is exploitable for many people. Includes network daemon denial of
          service attacks, cross-site scripting, and gaining user privileges.
        * `High` - a real problem, exploitable for many people in a default installation. Includes serious remote denial
          of service, local root privilege escalations, or data loss.
        * `Critical` - a world-burning problem, exploitable for nearly all people in a default installation. Includes
          remote root privilege escalations, or massive data loss.
